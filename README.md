# Hotel Nuclear

Weird 3D UNFINISHED game where you posses bodies of aliens and try to recover keys to elevators. It's really weird, and part of the weirdness was done on purpose:) The game may serve as an example of 3D procedurally-generated content using Castle Game Engine.

Using Castle Game Engine, see http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/ .

Some screenshots and notes about the game development can be found on https://plus.google.com/photos/+MichalisKamburelis/albums/6071303253222354641 , https://plus.google.com/+MichalisKamburelis/posts/hjCmAsPvuie .

## Command line options

- --touch-device To force using touch-device-like player control.
  Nice to test Android/iOS control on desktop, comfortable for development.

## License

GNU GPL >= 2. Except some data files on different (but also open-source) licenses, see notes in AUTHORS.txt files.
